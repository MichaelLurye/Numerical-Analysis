    def interpolate(self, f: callable, a: float, b: float, n: int) -> callable:
        """
        Interpolate the function f in the closed range [a,b] using at most n 
        points. Your main objective is minimizing the interpolation error.
        Your secondary objective is minimizing the running time. 
        The assignment will be tested on variety of different functions with 
        large n values. 
        
        Interpolation error will be measured as the average absolute error at 
        2*n random points between a and b. See test_with_poly() below. 

        Note: It is forbidden to call f more than n times. 

        Note: This assignment can be solved trivially with running time O(n^2)
        or it can be solved with running time of O(n) with some preprocessing.
        **Accurate O(n) solutions will receive higher grades.** 
        
        Note: sometimes you can get very accurate solutions with only few points, 
        significantly less than n. 
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        f : callable. it is the given function
        a : float
            beginning of the interpolation range.
        b : float
            end of the interpolation range.
        n : int
            maximal number of points to use.

        Returns
        -------
        The interpolating function.
